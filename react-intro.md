# React Intro 3/1/2022

A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Library - collections of code snippets (node_modules) that creates a technology

Package manager - yarn, organizes the node_modules

Scale / be scalable - grow in a way that supports your user base

Facebooks decides to make a JavaScript library - 1) code needs to be usable, 2) handle user interaction quickly and efficiently

Reusable Code
- React is made up of components, classes

User Interactions
- DOM - document object model, what the user sees, the visual representation of the code
- Only the tags that have a change get updated
- Virtual DOM - listen for changes and isolate where the changes happen, looking for a diff, reconciling the diff
- Nodes - in reference to the DOM all the HTML tags/element are called nodes
